CustomStopWatch
===============

This repository contains work on my Custom Stopwatch Android application.

The application serves to help users become more aware when using timers, simply, by paying attention to their music.
Music stoping will imply that the timer has ended, hence users can monitor their timers both visually and audiblly.


Inspiration:
..You know that one project you treat as your baby and love so much? This is mine!
I love music,and  I love to have a fair sense of how much time I use in my day to day activities; even better, 
I love to listen to music while performing some of those activies.

...so why not have both? Why not let my Spotify or Soundcloud playlist be my timer? Why not bake, garden, and code comfortably  without setting annoying alarms,or checking your watch every second? 

..and that is how  Custom Stopwatch was born.
